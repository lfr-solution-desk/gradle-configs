# GitHub Packages repository (gpr)

These two configs cover using with GitHub Packages being used as a Maven repo for sharing artifacts between repos.

## gpr-publishing.gradle

This config can be used in Liferay Worskpace when there is a need to share custom modules (be it modules, themes or wars), as Maven artifacts uploaded to the Maven repository hosted by GitHub. These artifacts can then be consumed as standard Maven dependencies in other repositories.
 
## Default behavior

Apply the config only to the projects you want to publish. You can use various Gradle constructs to do this, for example from `[root]/build.gradle`:
```
subprojects {
    if (!childProjects) {
        apply from: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lfr-solution-desk/gradle-configs/v0.3/src/gradle/gpr/gpr-publishing.gradle"
    }
}
```

If you only want to publish a subset of your projects in Gradle, filter the undesirable projects out -- simply don't apply the config to the undesirable projects. For exmaple, use: `if (!project.name.contains("-test") { ... }` etc.

**Note**: If you apply the config to a non-leaf project in a typical Liferay Workspace, a POM-only will be published for the project. If that's undesirable (which it most likely is), make sure to check using a condition like `!childProjects` before applying the config on a project.

**Note**: `apply from: ...` in Gradle (since 4.2) caches the response of URL, so it won't be fetched multiple times within single build. Also, when using `--offline`, locally cached version will be used, if available.

The default behaviour is following (suited for Solution Desk repositories):
* common `groupId` (`com.liferay.soldesk.<repo-name>`) used for all published modules, 
* long `artifactId` is used (not just `project.name` as usual)
    * making it unique across all the repos and beyond (`com.liferay.soldesk.<repo-name>.<module-name>`)  
* the same version for all modules 
    * being the version of the `rootProject` when the build is started

SNAPSHOT artifacts are published by default, the version of `rootProject` has `-SNAPSHOT` appended in each module's pom.xml being used for the publication.  

Sources and Javadoc are published when both of these are satisfied:
* given module supports it (it's a Java-based module); and
* a RELEASE is being published
    * GitHub Packages has a limitation where it present re-upload or a SNAPSHOT artifact when -sources or -javadoc were previously uploaded for the same SNAPSHOT version.  
 
The behavior of the actuall configiguration being applied can be changed via supported configuration properties, which must be set _before_ the config is applied. See below for supported properties. 
 
### Supported configuration properties

Various project properties prefixed with `liferay.gpr.publishing.` can be used to configure how the config will be applied. For details, please check [gradle.properties](gradle.properties), the _GPR Publishing_ section.

All these are read on per-project basis, because of the default Gradle behavior, properties are inherited from any parent project(s) up to the root project. So for individual subproject, you can use `[root]/modules/form-api/gradle.properties` to set any of the properties to apply to just that one module. You can also use any other supported way to set project project properteis in gradle, like setting them via CLI (`-P`), `[root]/gradle.properties` or even an init script. Simply whatever Gradle supports.
 
### GitHub Actions

Publishing should really be done in CI, where every aspect of the runtime environment is controlled and trackable. For using GitHub Actions, you can check the recommended workflow files in [.github/workflows](.github/workflows). Put then into the root of your repository and GitHub will pick them up and registed as GitHub Actions once pushed to server.

You can easily convert these into e.g. a `Jenkinsfile` if you want, it's only a matter of invoking the Gradle build on certain events occurring in the repository and passing some GitHub credentials (with "packages:write") to the build.  
 
## Detected artifacts for publishing

The Gradle config is applied on individual Gradle projects, one by one â€“ on these which should be published. So anywhere the config is applied, it will try to gather the artifacts for publishing and publish them when asked to. 

As long as the custom project is correctly created in Gradle (e.g. "java" plugin or "war" plugin is applied), the artifacts will be picked up as expected -- the "main" .jar or "main" .war. Support to publish the themes inside the "themes/" directory, built by NPM, was added to the config manually -- when no "war" plugin is detected on a theme project, it's assumed it's built by NPM and a .war will be created by `gulpBuild` task in `dist/${project.name}.war`.

If no artifact can be picked up, the config will just publish the pom.xml for given Gradle project (`packaging` == `pom`). In such case, any custom artifact that should be pubslihed can be added to our publication (named `nebula`), as described in (the Gradle docs)[https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_customization.html#sec:publishing_custom_artifacts_to_maven].
 
## gpr-consuming.gradle

This config should be applied on the `rootProject` of your Liferay Workspace:
```
// [root]/build.gradle
apply from: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lfr-solution-desk/gradle-configs/v0.3/gpr/gpr-consuming.gradle"
```                                                                         

On every project in the build, including the root project itself (`allprojects { ... }`), it adds the Maven repositories pointing to GitHub Packages repos being used by the declared dependencies of every configuration, so that they can be fetched.

Since only the first-level dependencies can be inspected (no transitional ones will be seen, since that would require resolving, which needs the repos already configured), additional repositories can be setup manually using configuration -- by passing the named of the GitHub repositories from where the needed artifacts were published. Check `liferay.gpr.consuming.repos.names` in [gradle.properties](gradle.properties). 

### Supported configuration properties

Various project properties prefixed with `liferay.gpr.consuming.` can be used to configure how the config will be applied. All these have to be set on the root project (where the config is applied), for example by setting them via CLI (`-P`), gradle.properties or even an init script. Simply whatever Gradle supports. 

For details, please check [gradle.properties](gradle.properties), the _GPR Consuming_ section.
